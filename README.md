# Chiyo - Tatsu

A backup file converter from Tachiyomi to Kotatsu (a very wip project)

## Struggles

### In C

-   Creating a self-made argparser (v1 in 3 days, v2 in 7 days)
-   Making the example usage of zlib fit my needs
-   protobuf-c doesn't support 'optional' in proto3 yet

### In C++

-   Dunno I'mma start today
